# Exam-App
Project of creating an exam app for colleges in Africa
This project will help student to write exams using their mobile phones rather than papers
Introduction
Education is the basic human requirement which can crucially determine an individual quality of life in the future. Education can improve the quality of life of an individual by giving them knowledge which could be used to make an individual self-reliant.
 This makes education one of the most important investments of any government (Cross, 2003). When more citizens are educated the communities way of life improves as they understand how the world operates and how to improve their lives and of their country.
As the rest of the world’s technological aspect has improved, most developing countries (i.e. African countries) lacks behind in technological advances. This includes in the Education sectors as well. They are disadvantaged compare to students in the Europe, America and Asia.
Students are being taught using only theory without visualising the actual technology in real life in most schools across the continent. Students end up finish schools without much knowledge of the technology including how to use computers. 
In this project I am proposing to build an app which will be used in schools to write exams on tablets or mobile phones on technological subjects thereby broadening their knowledge and competency in technology.

Literature Review or Background

Most schools and colleges still use the trading methods of exam using paper and pen. This is still the method which works well, but as the world is trying to cut down the usage of paper to save the environment, doing exams on tablets or mobile devices and computers is the way forward. This can reduce the amount teachers, lecturer’s handles paper work and concentrate more on teaching the students.
In today’s world of computers, gadgets, apps and the internet I believe it’s only fair that developing countries should also utilise the technology advances, which has inspired me to develop this app for students to use.
Procedure

The Methodology chosen for this type of App development is the Iterative and incremental, which will allow for the development in small portions at a given time and repeated to add more functionality, or Waterfall to develop the project.
I will also use a gnat chart to schedule various tasks which will performed when creating the Application. 
I will use a laptop (computer), and a programme called Android Studio to create the Application, my sql database which will be used to store all the materials for the exams.
The objectives of the app are
•	To increase technological among students to prepare them for work places
•	To reduce the amount of paper work used in exams.

Conclusion
The use of computers on a daily basis have increased tremendously of the last few years. Most children have access to mobile devices which connects to the internet. Schools must adapt and use these technology advances and apply in the education system in developing countries.
This project will be developed in phases to create the whole functioning App.
